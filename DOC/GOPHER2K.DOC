Where \t refers explicitly to the tab, except where double backslashed
where \\t is a string literal "\t"

The basic format of a Gopher+/Gopher2k query is thus:

  selector[\tsearch]\t+[REP][\tdataflag]\r\n[datablock]

selv = [split selector "\t"]
seln = [llength $selv]

Error numbers: 300 - TLS unavailable
               301 - go ahead

New filetypes: Q - 2k protocol message

In Gopher2k, if selv[0] is ".CAPS", case-insensitive, selv[seln-2] is
0, selv[seln-3] is +STARTTLS, and [llength [lrange $selv 1 end-4]] is
anything (it's ignored), the server will, if it does not support
STARTTLS but does support Gopher2k, give the following error & close
the connection as a regular Gopher connection. The message may vary
depending on the specific server, but it must be an error with the
number 300 in ASCII numerals as the first three characters.

  3300 STARTTLS unavailable (misconfigured or not supported)\t
 /\t<server hostname>\t<port>[\tgopherplusextensions]\r\n

If it supports STARTTLS and is properly configured (PEMfile and all),
the client receives the following line and the connection will not
be closed by the server:

  Q301 Go ahead\t/\t<host>\t<port>[\t<gopherplusextensions>]\r\n

At that point, there should be a TLS handshake and the connection
proceeds as a regular Gopher or Gopher2k connection.
